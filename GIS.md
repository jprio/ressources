# Formats
* GeoTIFF : For many image types such as TIFF format and JPEG files, the georeferencing information is contained in a separate sidecar file with .tfw and .jfw extensions respectively.
GeoTIFF are TIFF files that contain spatial referencing information the form of georeferenced raster imagery. Aerial imagery (or aerial photography), satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and shaded relief are some examples of geoTiff files.
* Digital Elevation Models (.dem, .flt, .csv, .tif, .txt, .hgt)
* Esri File Geodatabase (.gdb)
* Esri Layer File (.lyr)
* Shapefile (.shp)
* Geography Markup Language (.gml)
* KML - Keyhole Markup Language (.kml)
* GeoJSON (.json, .geojson)
* LiDAR (.las, .laz, .zlas)
* raster ([The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide to Geospatial Raster Data](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-geospatial-raster-data-feb7673f6db0))

# Outils
* Rasterio : The first library ever made for accessing geographical raster files is Geospatial Data Abstration Library, GDAL. It was first developed in C and then extended to Python. This way, the Python version provides only little abstraction from the C version. Rasterio which is based on GDAL, tries to solve this problem by providing an easier and higher-level interface.
