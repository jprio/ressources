# №1: Professional Certificate Program in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence By MIT
The first certificate on this list is offered by MIT. The professional certificate program in machine learning and artificial intelligence is a short program offered to people with previous machine learning knowledge and newcomers, giving them the ability to gain the latest knowledge in the field.
This certificate is not cheap — $325 to register for it — because it’s not just a test, rather a full set of courses and materials. This short program's core focuses on using machine learning algorithms and techniques in big data and text processing. But, if you want, you can extend the scope of the certificate — for extra fees — to cover more precise usage of machine learning, such as machine learning in the medical field, or computer version, or efficient deep learning, etc.
Each of the courses in this short program has a set number of days that you need to complete them, and the entire program courses need to be completed within 36 months of registering for the program.

# №2: Certificate in Machine Learning By Stanford
The machine learning course and certificate offered by Stanford University is perhaps the better option for those who want to get into machine learning and earn a certificate at the same time. You can either audit the course for free or pay $79 to obtain a certificate upon completing the course.
This course is one of the most famous and wholesome machine learning courses you could come by; it is taught by professor Andrew Ng one of Coursera's founders and an instructor with more than 10 million happy students. The machine learning course alone was taken/still by almost 4 million students. The course also offers subtitles in 10 languages for students whose English is not their first or preferred language.
During this course — 11 weeks — you will learn everything from the absolute beginning, covering maths and statistics to machine learning algorithms' fundamentals and their application in computer vision, medicine, audio manipulation, and database mining.

# №3: IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate
Another certificate you can earn by taking a course on Coursera is the machine learning professional certificate offered by one of the computing industry legends, IBM. Like the Stanford University course, you can audit this course for free or earn a $39/ month certificate.
This professional certificate program includes 6 courses covering all the knowledge you need to understand both the theoretical aspects of machine learning algorithms and their practical uses. Although you may make more of the course if one has some programming knowledge, you can still take this course even if you don’t know much programming.
This course will also teach you how to use Jupyter notebooks and IBM Watson to build and develop your own projects to add to your portfolio once you have completed the course.

# №4: Machine Learning Certificate By Harvard
The final course-based certificate in this list is the machine learning certificate offered by Harvard University on edX. This course is a part of a bigger, broader data science certificate offered by Harvard University. You can either audit this course or earn a certificate upon completion for $99.
This course will cover the basics of machine learning, the basic algorithms, and techniques, how and when to use cross-validation, how to build a recommendation system, and some of the commonly used, most popular, and new machine learning algorithms.
This course is designed to be completed within 8 weeks. However, it is also self-paced, which means you can take however amount of time you need to finish this course and earn your certificate.

# №5: Professional Machine Learning Engineer By Google
So far, all the certificates we covered required a specific course or a set of courses to be completed to earn the certificate. The professional machine learning engineer certificate by Google is different. This is just a certificate, meaning you need only to take a test to obtain this certificate.
For $200, you can take this Google test to measure your familiarity and ability to frame machine learning problems, design solutions, process data, and develop machine learning models. Not just that, you also need to show that you can automate efficient machine learning pipelines and optimize your solutions.
Although this certificate is not accompanied by a course that you must take to earn the certificate, Google still offers materials that you can use to prepare for the test as well as webinars given by Google experts to help you pass that test and make the most of the provided materials.

# №6: AWS Certified Machine Learning
A more specific certificate is offered by Amazon, in particular the AWS system. The AWS certified machine learning is a certificate designed to measure one’s ability to design, develop and deploy machine learning models using the AWS cloud. This certificate can be obtained with a fee of $400.
Similar to the Google machine learning engineer certificate, the AWS certified machine learning specialty doesn’t require a specific course completion to obtain. This certificate is aimed more towards people who are very familiar with machine learning algorithms and techniques rather than complete beginners.
The test is available in three languages, English, Korean and Chinese. Amazon also offers some materials and practice tests that you can use to prepare for the test and pass it from the first try.

# Deep Learning Specialization — Coursera
Also taught by Andrew Ng, this specialization is a more advanced course series for anyone interested in learning about neural networks and Deep Learning, and how they solve many problems.
The assignments and lectures in each course utilize the Python programming language and use the TensorFlow library for neural networks. This is naturally a great follow up to Ng’s Machine Learning course since you’ll receive a similar lecture style but now will be exposed to using Python for machine learning.
Provider: Andrew Ng, deeplearning.ai
Cost: Free to audit, $49/month for Certificate

# Machine Learning with Python — Coursera
Another beginner course, this one focuses solely on the most fundamental machine learning algorithms. The instructor, slide animations, and explanation of the algorithms combine very nicely to give you an intuitive feel for the basics.
This course uses Python and is somewhat lighter on the mathematics behind the algorithms. With each module you’ll get a chance to spool up an interactive Jupyter notebook in your browser to work through the new concepts you just learned. Each notebook reinforces your knowledge and gives you concrete instructions for using an algorithm on real data.
Provider: IBM, Cognitive Class
Price: Free to audit, $39/month for Certificate

# Advanced Machine Learning Specialization — Coursera
This is another advanced series of courses that casts a very wide net. If you have an interest in covering as many machine learning techniques as possible, this Specialization the key to a balanced and extensive online curriculum.
The instruction in this course is fantastic: extremely well-presented and concise. Due to its advanced nature, you will need more math than any of the other courses listed so far. If you have already taken a beginner course and brushed up on linear algebra and calculus, this is a good choice to fill out the rest of your machine learning expertise.
Much of what’s covered in this Specialization is pivotal to many machine learning projects.
Provider: National Research University Higher School of Economics
Cost: Free to audit, $49/month for Certificate
It takes about 8-10 months to complete this series of courses, so if you start today, in a little under a year you’ll have learned a massive amount of machine learning and be able to start tackling more cutting-edge applications.
Throughout the months, you will also be creating several real projects that result in a computer learning how to read, see, and play. These projects will be great candidates for your portfolio and will result in your GitHub looking very active to any interested employers.

# Machine Learning — EdX
This is an advanced course that has the highest math prerequisite out of any other course in this list. You’ll need a very firm grasp of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and programming. The course has interesting programming assignments in either Python or Octave, but the course doesn’t teach either language.
One of the biggest differences with this course is the coverage of the probabilistic approach to machine learning. If you’ve been interested in reading a textbook, like Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective — which is one of the most recommended data science books in Master’s programs — then this course would be a fantastic complement.
Provider: Columbia
Cost: Free to audit, $300 for Certificate

# Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders — Fast.ai
Fast.ai produced this excellent, free machine learning course for those that already have roughly a year of Python programming experience.
It's astounding how much time and effort the founders of Fast.ai have put into this course — and other courses on their site. The content is based on the University of San Diego's Data Science program, so you'll find that the lectures are done in a classroom with students, similar to the MIT Opencourseware style.
The course has many videos, some homework assignments, extensive notes, and a discussion board. Unfortunately, you won't find graded assignments and quizzes or a certification upon completion, so if you'd rather have those features then Coursera/Edx would be a better route for you.
Much of the course content is applied, so you'll learn how to not only how to use the ML models but also launch them on cloud providers, like AWS.
Provider: Fast.ai
Cost: Free
This course is great if you're a programmer that just wants to learn and apply ML techniques, but I find there is one drawback for me. They teach machine learning through the use of their open-source library (called fastai), which is a layer over other machine learning libraries, like PyTorch.
If you just care about using ML for your project and don't care about learning something like PyTorch, then the fastai library offers convenient abstractions. Personally, I tend to prefer working with the underlying libraries directly.
