# Quantum computing

* [Jonathan Hui - Quantum Computing series](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/qc-quantum-computing-series-10ddd7977abd)
* [James Wooton](https://decodoku.medium.com/)
* [Introduction to quantum computing: Basic quantum theory.](http://akyrillidis.github.io/notes/quant_post_4) : This is part of a (probably) long list of posts regarding quantum computing. In this post, we will talk about quantum states, observables, what it means to measure a quantum state, and the dynamics of quantum states.
* [Get started with IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/) : Develop workflows that incorporate both quantum circuits and classical computations, and quickly build quantum applications at scale… all with the systems, tools, and services available in IBM Quantum Experience.
* [How Do I Build a Quantum Computer in My House?](https://medium.com/qiskit/how-do-i-build-a-quantum-computer-in-my-house-1c7e9dc0c242) : Open-access frameworks like Qiskit let you program a quantum computer over the cloud, and you’re an enterprising person who has a familiarity with quantum computers. So, if you happen to find yourself in need of something to do, how about trying to program a quantum computer that you built yourself?
* [Introduction to Coding Quantum Algorithms:A Tutorial Series Using Qiskit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04359.pdf) : As the field of Quantum Computing continues to grow, so too has the general public’s interest in testing some of the publicly available quantum computers. However, many might find learning all of the supplementary information that goes into quantum algorithms to be a daunting task, and become discouraged. This tutorial is a series of lessons, aimed to teach the basics of quantum algorithms to those who may have little to no background in quantum physics and/or minimal knowledge of coding in python. Each lesson covers select physics/coding topics needed for writing quantum algorithms, eventually building up a toolset for tackling more and more challenging quantum algorithms. This tutorial series is designed to provide readers from any background with two services: 1) A concise and thorough understanding of some of the most popular/academically important quantum algorithms. 2) A fluent understanding of how to write code for quantum algorithms, using IBM’s publicly available Qiskit.

* [Introduction to Quantum Computing par Chris Ferrie sur Medium](https://csferrie.medium.com/qubits-qubits-qubits-more-is-different-8c2a5f9686c0)
  * Week 1 [The Quantum Hypothesis](https://csferrie.medium.com/introduction-to-quantum-computing-49b31b96e70f) : Lecture 1 introduces the necessary components of classical computing and provides some historical overview of the field of quantum computing. We also see how different types of information processes has different power.
  * Week 2 [What is a qubit ?](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-a-qubit-dbce0a341c6a) : In Lecture 2 you will be introduced to qubits and the mathematical tools needed to work with them. Dirac notation is a powerful calculational tool to analyse quantum circuits, and perform linear algebraic manipulations more generally. We will learn about quantum measurement and what it means to “look at” a qubit. But what does a qubit state “look like”? We will study the Bloch sphere representation of a qubit as well as complete the story of Dirac notation to see how all of the objects of study can be written in this picture.
  * Week 3 : In Lecture 3 we add new dimensions to our quantum information — exponentially many new dimensions! We look at how to represent multiple qubits and the new feature of entanglement.Today we will work through exercises to ensure you are a proficient user of these tools — that is, let’s make you a quantum mechanic!All the abstract nonsense you need to program a quantum computer.
  * Week 4
Before you are set loose on the quantum world, know that things are different in ways beyond just possessing more possibilities. Quantum information is severely restricted, as we will see in Lecture 4.
No-gos, the quantum no-nos
Lecture 4 of Welcome to Introduction to Quantum Computing.

Now that we can deal with multiple qubits, the quantum world is our oyster. This week we used the full power of Dirac notation to prove some fundamental no-go theorems. But no-go theorems are a bit of a bummer — let’s create something!
Non-transitive project-based learning

  * Week 5
This week you will fill your tool box with the canonical gate set and learn how to quickly recognise their utility and tricks for working with them.
Shhhh… the quantum cheat sheet
Lecture 5 Introduction to Quantum Computing

Practicing calculations and internalising some common tricks and identities is critical to analysing and creating quantum circuits. Here I provide some simple tasks and exercises to get you started.
All the quantum gate identities fit for print
Lab 5 of Introduction to Quantum Computing.

  * Week 6
This week you will be introduced to the first two canonical quantum protocols: superdense coding and teleportation. These demonstrate that entanglement can be used as a resource for some tasks. You’ll have your first taste as designing protocols as well as analysing them.
My first quantum protocol
Lecture 6 of Introduction to Quantum Computing.

In Lecture 6 you were introduced to superdense coding and quantum teleportation. We looked at the circuits and even built them with the Quirk drag-and-drop simulator. In this Lab you will build both protocols in the three programming languages you were assigned in Lab 4.
Superdense coding and quantum teleportation in three quantum programming languages
Lab 6 of Introduction to Quantum Computing

  * Week 7
We will continue the theme of quantum advantages this week by studying the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. This algorithm also deterministically solves a problem which is impossible to solve via classical means with the same number of resources. This will be your first taste of a computational speed-up provided by quantum computers.
Quansulting the oracle
Lecture 7 of Introduction to Quantum Computing

  * Week 8
This week you will learn about the high-level structure of quantum algorithms and some primitives such as superposition, digital logic, phase logic, and uncomputation. With these you’ll at least be able to fake it until you make it!

In this course, we will review seminal position papers of the field, understand the notion of model interpretability and explainability, discuss in detail different classes of interpretable models (e.g., prototype based approaches, sparse linear models, rule based techniques, generalized additive models), post-hoc explanations (black-box explanations including counterfactual explanations and saliency maps), and explore the connections between interpretability and causality, debugging, and fairness. The course will also emphasize on various applications which can immensely benefit from model interpretability including criminal justice and healthcare.
