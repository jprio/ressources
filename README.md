"Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs" is a beginner-friendly online course offering a practical and coding-focused introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework.
* Fundamentals of Machine Learning
  * [Probability theory](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-fundamentals-of-machine-learning-part-1-a156b4703e69)
This is part one in a series of topics I consider fundamental to machine learning. Probability theory is a mathematical framework for quantifying our uncertainty about the world. It allows us (and our software) to reason effectively in situations where being certain is impossible. Probability theory is at the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. The goal of this post is to cover the vocabulary and mathematics needed before applying probability theory to machine learning applications. 
  * [Maximum likeliyhood](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximum-likelihood-estimation-984af2dcfcac)
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a frequentist approach for estimating the parameters of a model given some observed data.
  * [Information Theory](https://towardsdatascience.com/fundamentals-of-machine-learning-part-3-b305933f00cd)
The purpose of this post is to cover important concepts from Information Theory and describe how they are used in machine learning. Many of the topics here will build on concepts we discussed in the post on Probability Theory, such as independence and expectation.

* [Machine Learning par Université de Stanford (Andrew Ng)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) : The purpose of this post is to cover important concepts from Information Theory and describe how they are used in machine learning. Many of the topics here will build on concepts we discussed in the post on Probability Theory, such as independence and expectation.
* [Construire un ordinateur moderne à partir de principes de base : de Nand à Tetris (cours centré sur un projet)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer] : In this project-centered course* you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks (Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?action=enroll) : This course will teach you how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. Thanks to deep learning, computer vision is working far better than just two years ago, and this is enabling numerous exciting applications ranging from safe autonomous driving, to accurate face recognition, to automatic reading of radiology images. 
* [Réseau de neurones et deep learning (Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) : If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago.

* [Machine Learning byGeorgia Institute of Technology](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262) : This class is offered as CS7641 at Georgia Tech where it is a part of the Online Masters Degree (OMS). Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.
Machine Learning is a graduate-level course covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences.
The first part of the course covers Supervised Learning, a machine learning task that makes it possible for your phone to recognize your voice, your email to filter spam, and for computers to learn a bunch of other cool stuff.
In part two, you will learn about Unsupervised Learning. Ever wonder how Netflix can predict what movies you'll like? Or how Amazon knows what you want to buy before you do? Such answers can be found in this section!
* [Reinforcement Learning byGeorgia Institute of Technology Offered at Georgia Tech as CS 8803](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600) : You should take this course if you have an interest in machine learning and the desire to engage with it from a theoretical perspective. Through a combination of classic papers and more recent work, you will explore automated decision-making from a computer-science perspective. You will examine efficient algorithms, where they exist, for single-agent and multi-agent planning as well as approaches to learning near-optimal decisions from experience. At the end of the course, you will replicate a result from a published paper in reinforcement learning.
