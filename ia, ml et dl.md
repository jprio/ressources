Additionally, there are over 30 time series specific transforms usable in the sklearn style of .fit(), .transform() and .inverse_transform(). All of these function directly on Pandas Dataframes, without the need for conversion to proprietary objects.
All models support forecasting multivariate (multiple time series) outputs and also support probabilistic (upper/lower bound) forecasts. Most models can readily scale to tens and even hundreds of thousands of input series. Many models also support passing in user-defined exogenous regressors.
These models are all designed for integration in an AutoML feature search which automatically finds the best models, preprocessing, and ensembling for a given dataset through genetic algorithms.

The library also makes it easy to backtest models, and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models. The ML-based models can be trained on multiple time series, and some of the models offer probabilistic forecasts.
* [atspy](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-libraries-that-help-in-time-series-problems-d59473e48ddd) stands for Automated Time Series Models in Python. The goal of the library is to forecast univariate time series.

At the end of the course, you will replicate a result from a published paper in reinforcement learning.
* [Interpretability and Explainability in Machine Learning](https://interpretable-ml-class.github.io/) : As machine learning models are increasingly being employed to aid decision makers in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and criminal justice, it is important to ensure that the decision makers (end users) correctly understand and consequently trust the functionality of these models. This graduate level course aims to familiarize students with the recent advances in the emerging field of interpretable and explainable ML. In this course, we will review seminal position papers of the field, understand the notion of model interpretability and explainability, discuss in detail different classes of interpretable models (e.g., prototype based approaches, sparse linear models, rule based techniques, generalized additive models), post-hoc explanations (black-box explanations including counterfactual explanations and saliency maps), and explore the connections between interpretability and causality, debugging, and fairness. The course will also emphasize on various applications which can immensely benefit from model interpretability including criminal justice and healthcare.
